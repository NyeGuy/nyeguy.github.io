When studying the history of computer graphics, it is easy to come across the legend of the genesis effect. The early days of Pixar, when still an incubated project at Industrial Light and Magic, and Ed Catmull and the early researchers from University of Utah were inventing what it meant to create realistic looking shaders in the computer.

Star Trek II, with effects being done by ILM and the illustrius Ken Ralston, took a gamble on creating a one minute sequence entirely in the computer. The genesis topedo, when impacted on a small moon, would go about transforming the surface to a living breathing planet, capable of sustaining "Whatever life we see fit." This sequence was the dawn of the graphic pipeline that eventually evolved into Jurrassic park dinosaurs and Buzz lightyear wisecracks. This was the dawn of computer graphics as we know it.

It is legend, and hallows the halls of the Bay Area graphics firms as the origins of computer graphics.
But there was another team that was working on what would become the evolutionary focus of computer graphics.

A small group of video game developers in Mesquit, Texas released a game where players ran through a fantastical 3D underworld dungeon and shot pixelated demons from Hell. 2D imagery had been done a number of times in computer games, but the art of moving three axis around in real time had only been realized by the company id, in their previous release, Castle Wolfenstein. id was visionary on many levels. They didn't just build a piece of software, the independent nature of the team created a new way of distribution as well. Id was the first company, that actually gave away their experiential product as shareware to build an audience. And then they gave them the tools to build on it make it their own. The users could actually change or "mod" the game.

When you read marketing copy about the advantages of game engines, I'm sure it will have nice looking images and speak of glorious updates to the particle systems, the lighting or the fluid dynamics. It's as if the common understanding about game engines is that they make good looking things. This is true, but it is not their real value. From day one, games have been about the performant mechanisms to convey an experience in *real time.* The game engine was valuing the thing that the rendering legacy system did not. Real time performance.

Real time software distributed on the internet is immensely powerful. As demonstrated even with Doom, the content distribution was reliant on the internet not on the marketing channel. And the a surprising economic model proved that real value could come from giving away the experience... for *free.*

Real time development also allowed game developers themselves to practice production methods that embraced experimentation. And while it appeared to look unplanned, it's unique structure ultimately allowed for better experience design.
