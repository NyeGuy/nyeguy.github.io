Wealth of Networks
Brick by Brick
The Mystery of Capital
Metatations
Superintelligence



My summer reading including a binge read of Jack Weatherford's *Ghenghis Kahn and the Making of the Modern World.* Here are my five rules to the efficient conquest of Asia.

### Goods Not Kills
Correct success metrics
Kahn was not about battle or honor, it was all about maximizing the take. If he could knock over a city without killing anyone, he would have. Sure he killed loads of people, but the point was not about devising ways to kill, it was simply an efficient method to maximize the looting.

### Ability Not Inheritance
Kill Aristocrats, revshare loyalty
In the 12th century in both tribes and aristocrats followed family ties. Kahn created a brotherhood out of skilled alliances. Productivity was the metric for brotherhood, not actual brotherhood.

Artistocrats were essentially killed off.

### Base 10 on Horseback
Agile Scalable deployment
Concentric Circles, Waves, Speed, Build only Bridges
While armies of 10s of thousands marched, the mongols swarmed in waves, chipping away at systems, wrecking havok.

### Join us Or Die
No Prisoners, Assimilation into the "Brotherhood Code"
They didn't create the infrastructure for prisons.
Base 10 allowed others to join into the mix. Hindus could join with Mongols, didn't matter what religion. It was about being efficient and part of the brotherhood of maximizing returns.


### Legend Preceeds Victory
Fear is  your ally. The better the scary story, the more chance for easy victory.

*Empire of Blue Water* pirates knew that being scary was better than being good in combat. The more you hammed it up, the more freaked out your conquest would be.
