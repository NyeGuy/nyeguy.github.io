### Cameras
Shut off their cameras - their body language positioned in a way to show me how hard their lives are. Cameras on - or you are absent. there is no negotiation. Your camera is off, you aren't here.

### Video

Understand that not all content is created equal.


### Persistence

Discord, I open a channel between myself and my students. Doing this, I discovered not one signed up for office hours.
The con was that at Saturday night, while watching Netflix with my wife I would be reviewing work and giving pointers. The benefit was that I felt connected to the students.


### Collaborative Problem Solving

Class time, now that the high level cognitive lifting has been abstracted by video tutorials, has now become a place to put the students on the spot. I ask them to call up their work, and then metaphorically push them into the pool. Many will come in and say "I couldn't figure out..." - to which I say "Gosh, too bad. " The idea is that they will learn the most critical lesson that I teach, problem solving is about shipping. If they haven't shipped, there is no excuse, you must quite literally "figure it out."
Rubricks based on skill and knowledge acquisiion is useless.
