I am often asked this question. I thought I would list my thoughts as to which engine is best for which use case.

Unreal Engine
=====
The Unreal Engine is for AAA development. It's a mighty tank pf a game engine that is really good at making really nice looking third person, first person or strategy games. A major studio can use it and scale a team of 100's. It's dependent on a versioning system like Perforce, and has many complicated moving parts. So massive a piece of software, that specialists might never go to certain parts of the engine. It's a constant discovery of "oh, that's what that does."

Flooded with Fortnite money, Epic is in complete control of the driver's seat. From their marketing assault, it is clear they wish to own cinematic production in hollywood, or really anything where you shoot content. And with a real time workflow, they might just win. In full disclosure, I work in it daily. I also work on microsoft windows daily, and in autodesk maya.  As a licensed and privatized company, their strategy is to own the metaverse by "Complete total absorbtion." If there is something innovative in the space, it is bought, or it is granted. You might see those little logos around the internet. Basically, the king must own it all.

If you are interested in creating AAA quality game within the fairly known design paradigms of the gaming universe, this is a good choice. You might need to choose a focus, like characters, or effects, or level design. Game companies of this size need specialists who have a stong ability to problem solve. Using Unreal Engine requires you to work well with others, both creatively, but also in collaborations technically.


Unity
=====
Unity applications currently account for around three billion installs around the world. As a 3d interactive development package, it is the dominant player. It is also the major player in independent and mid-tier game development. It is fairly standard in interactive design and commercial application development.

Unity is also a private company, who have weird licensing when you actually start making real money. Since their focus is more diverse, larger interactive market vs a AAA game market, they tend to have the plugins for some of the more innovative things like augmented reality, or Machine learning agents. Unity also is forming initiatives with companies like Volvo, and developing educational content with USC. It's clear they are attempting to position themselves as an interactive artist's tool, more than a game engine. There will always be games developed with it, but many other things will be built with it as well.

I might make a note that I think Unity's timeline feature is slightly better thought through than Unreal's sequencer. With Cinemamachine I think camera fly throughs and shot creation are nifty. Sequencer, while the promise is there, is still mostly a clunker.

Godot
=====
This engine is a darling of mine. It's the Blender of the game engine world. And with a small team of developers and a passionate open source community ralleying behind it, it is gainging traction at a remarkable rate. As tools that build something creative, and the fact that computer graphics will be how the metaverse will be built, I believe that it should be free and unlicensed. I'm not going to make my debate for open source here, but I will say that Godot will be at the center of that debate when it comes.

Right now, it is best for 2d games. Pixel art is especially fun. GDScript is much like python, which is also a very valuable arrow to have in the quiver. Relative to Unity and Unreal, Godot has a much small base. But it is rabid, and when the Vulcan renderer comes live, and if they can maintain their funding, I see this engine gaining a lot of interesting use cases.

When we start distributing our networks and commerce, are we really going to cut in Unreal or Unity? Godot, as open source, is the natural choice for decentralized or non-conformist gaming.

The Gateway Engines
=====
For the "just getting started" type, here are some of my recommendations. I tried game engines a number of times. I bounced out of Unity when I first tried. I struggled through Xcode development with cocos, barely understanding the process. I then tried Love for a small time, but grew tired of lua. As a language it simply made no sense.

I discovered Construct 2. An HTML5 engine that had a visual coding interface. You snapped events and functions together like lego. For me, it worked. I soon began to understand game development concepts. I knew why I had to create variables, I understood why I used what.
I have heard that Game Maker is also of a similar approachability, but I have never used it. These engines, to me, despite having games that have been shipped on them, are the gateway engines. Essentially, they have a low enough technical overhead to let in the artists. 

Once you are in, you get it. And when you have reached a point that you want to actually build something a bit more than a starter level, you move on. In my case it was Godot and Unity.

Web
=====
The web is also a wonderful place to screw around with 3d and game engines. A favorite of mine is A Frame. By using HTML tags you can place 3d objects, add a little animaiton and even do VR. This world is built on a wonderful little library called three.js, a javascript core that actually renders 3d objects in the browser. Chances are you have seen something around the internet, and I'm pretty sure three.js was behind it.

On top of three.js, engines like babylon.js or the web based playcanvas (which was bought by snap)
