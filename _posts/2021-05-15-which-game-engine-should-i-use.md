I am often asked this question. I thought I would list my thoughts as to which engine is best for which use case.

Unreal Engine
=====

The Unreal Engine is for AAA development. It's a mighty tank that is good at making beautiful realism for third person, first person or strategy games. Major studios use it to scale a team of 100's. It's dependent on a versioning system like Perforce, and has many complicated moving parts. It is so large, many users may never go to every part of the engine. It's a constant discovery of "oh, that's what that does."

Flooded with Fortnite money, Epic is the [Mongol horde](2020-5-01-five-rules-gheghis-kahn) of the Game Engine world. From their marketing assault, it is clear they wish to own cinematic production in hollywood, or really anything where there's a camera and subject. And with a real time workflow being as disruptive as it is, they might just win. (In full disclosure, I work in it daily. I also work in under Microsoft and Autodesk overlords.) As a licensed and privatized company, Epic's strategy is to own the metaverse by "Complete total absorbtion." If there is something innovative in the space, it is bought, or it is granted. You might see those little "Epic Megagrant" logos around the internet. Hail to the King, baby.

If you are interested in creating AAA quality game within the fairly known design paradigms of the gaming universe, this is a good choice. You might need to choose a focus, like characters, or effects, or level design. Game companies of a mid to large size need specialists who have a stong ability to problem solve in this engine. Using Unreal Engine requires you to work well with others, both creatively, but also technically.


Unity
=====

Unity applications currently account for around three billion installs around the world. As a 3d interactive development package, it is the dominant player. It is also the major player in independent and mid-tier game development. It is fairly standard in interactive design and commercial application development.

Unity is also a private company, who have a weird licensing system when you actually start making real money. Since their focus is more diverse, (larger interactive market vs a AAA game market) they tend to have plugins for some of the more innovative trends like Augmented Reality, or Machine Learning. Unity also is forming initiatives with auto companies, and developing an ecosystem of educational content. It's clear they are positioning themselves as an interactive artist's tool, more than just a game engine. There will always be games developed with it, but many other things will be built with it as well.

Godot
=====

As an advocate of open source, this engine is a darling of mine. It's the Blender of the game engine world. There is a small team of developers led by the remarkable ... With a passionate open source community rallying behind it, it is gaining traction at an astounding rate. Right now, it is best for 2d games, though recently their foray into 3d and the projected development of the Vulcan renderer will change that.  GDScript is much like python, which turns out to be a really good way to acquire artist and designer types as users. Relative to Unity and Unreal, Godot has a much smaller base, but they are rabid.

I feel that Godot is uniquely positioned when it comes to innovative gaming and decentralized development. When we start distributing our networks and commerce, are we really going to cut in Unreal or Unity? Godot, as open source, is the natural choice for teams that are looking to create autonomous or community driven game systems. The community, not a centralized player, will shape it's functional use. (Whatever that turns out to be.)

The Gateway Engines
=====

For the "just getting started" type, here are some of my recommendations. I tried game engines a number of times. I bounced out of Unity when I first tried. I struggled through Xcode development with cocos, barely understanding the process. I then tried Love for a small time, but grew tired of lua. As a language it simply made no sense.

I discovered Construct 2. An HTML5 engine that had a visual coding interface. You snapped events and functions together like lego. For me, it worked. I soon began to understand game development concepts. I knew why I had to create variables, I understood why I used what.
I have heard that Game Maker is also of a similar approachability, but I have never used it. These engines, to me, despite having games that have been shipped on them, are the gateway engines. Essentially, they have a low enough technical overhead to let in the artists.

Once you are in, you get it. And when you have reached a point that you want to actually build something a bit more than a starter level, you move on. In my case it was Godot and Unity.

Web
=====

The web is also a wonderful place to screw around with 3d and game engines. A favorite of mine is A Frame. By using HTML tags you can place 3d objects, add a little animaiton and even do VR. This world is built on a wonderful little library called three.js, a javascript core that actually renders 3d objects in the browser. Chances are you have seen something around the internet, and I'm pretty sure three.js was behind it.

On top of three.js, engines like babylon.js or the web based playcanvas (which was bought by snap)
