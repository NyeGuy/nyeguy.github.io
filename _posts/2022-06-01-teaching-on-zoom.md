Teaching on zoom, I discovered I had to become keenly aware of how much cognitive capacity college students had for learning


* This is a work in progress blog post - thx, mgmt.

In the fall of 2020 I began teaching at the Savannah College of Art and Design in their interactive design and game development program. This was during the height of the covid pandemic and I had to begin teaching on zoom. I started my first week in full optimism and energy, only to be smacked with black boxes of student refusal to put cameras on.
This was no way to connect with students, and as a result the work suffered.

I vowed the next quarter would be different.

### Cameras and Cognitive Capacity
The first thing I did in my next quarter, was to unequivocally say:

*"Cameras On. There is no compromise. Cameras on - or you are absent."*

This small change, of using cameras on to engage with made all of the difference. The work was better, the class was happier, and most of those who kept cameras on acutally allowed for the cognitive injection I gave them. I had to be a jerk for the first class, but setting the tone made it better for everyone. The confidence I received from teaching them was amazing. I believe many of those kids are bound to manifest into real graphics artists.


# Camera On - Engagement Range
I would track each week what I call "Engagement Range."

Essentially, I would estimate the amount of time I could engage with 20 to 25 year old students and maintain their high cognitive functioning through zoom. I'd watch their faces, I'd see if they got the concepts, I'd often ask questions or make small talk to  keep them looped. At first I noticed that the Enagement Range with cameras on averaged between 45 minutes for software specific teaching or 1 hour and 15 minutes if it was a "follow along" where I demo a small thing, and then do "crowd work" while they build.

Classes at SCAD are required to be 2.5 hours for a studio. Which is extrodinarily difficult to maintain. They are also twice a week. So, figuring out how to generate engaging edutainment that had a high absorbtion rate, while filling up large quantities of time, that also maintained a quality output from the students was extremely difficult. Quantifying how much time they could spend doing what kind of learning activity became a key performance index.


# Video for Software Specific Teaching
This is quite often the worst, and can often be done extremely badly. As soon as a teaching says, here let me show you how to ... by the time they have clicked file open, the students are often already looking for a place to take a nap. It's hard to teach the unreal engine when you see the flicker of youtube videos all over their faces.

What I began to notice however was that while they were completely checked out while I demoed in class, they would universally ask for the video of the class when it came time to do the work. They would watch me with full control of my speed. They would fast forward through the moments I rambled on, but would repeat the sections where I animated or blueprinted over and over. The video was what they wanted when they were software focused, not personal engagement. But this became a problem of copying my actions directly. They wouldn't  


So I tried to draw things out first outside the software, get them to think through what we are about to do, and then have them talk about it when I launch the program. I attempted to make the content not so much interesting, but modular and extensible, so it could be played with in different levels of skill.

The idea would be

# Follow Along and Crowd Work


# Scope, Slice, Spike and Ship
If I could "get them going" as opposed to showing the full spectrum, I could do a couple of weeks of intense



### Video

Understand that not all content is created equal.


### Persistence

Discord, I open a channel between myself and my students. Doing this, I discovered not one signed up for office hours.
The con was that at Saturday night, while watching Netflix with my wife I would be reviewing work and giving pointers. The benefit was that I felt connected to the students.


### Collaborative Problem Solving

Class time, now that the high level cognitive lifting has been abstracted by video tutorials, has now become a place to put the students on the spot. I ask them to call up their work, and then metaphorically push them into the pool. Many will come in and say "I couldn't figure out..." - to which I say "Gosh, too bad. " The idea is that they will learn the most critical lesson that I teach, problem solving is about shipping. If they haven't shipped, there is no excuse, you must quite literally "figure it out."
Rubricks based on skill and knowledge acquisiion is useless.
