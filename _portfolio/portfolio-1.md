AI is rapidly advancing into computer graphics. While it is still somewhat early for these technologies to be easily accessible to the artist, within a short period of time we will find ourselves experiencing a boom of productive creation. For more on my thoughts on the evolution of artificial intelligence in computer graphics, please see my post here.

Otherwise, have fun exploring some of the nonsense below.  


### ShatnerGAN

For whatever reason, I spent a week ripping Captain Kirk shots from the original Star Trek series and training StyleGAN2 from NVidia. This experiment had 15000 close ups of James T Kirk, and the model was trained for 5000 steps.
