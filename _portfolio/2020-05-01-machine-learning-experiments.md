AI is rapidly advancing into computer graphics. While it is still somewhat early for these technologies to be easily accessible to the artist, within a short period of time we will find ourselves experiencing a boom of productive creation. For more on my thoughts on the evolution of artificial intelligence in animation, [please see my post here.](http://nyeguy.github.io/posts/2021/07/2020-05-15-machine-learning-and-animation)

Otherwise, have fun exploring some of the nonsense below.  


### ShatnerGAN

For whatever reason, I spent a week ripping Captain Kirk shots from the original Star Trek series and training StyleGAN2 from NVidia. This experiment had 15000 close ups of James T Kirk, and the model was trained for 5000 steps.
