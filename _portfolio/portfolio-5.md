After graduating from the Academy of Art in 2004, I began to work right away as an animator. It was a natural assumption for both myself and for others that this should be my focus. I started at Electronic Arts, but was soon plucked by Sony Imageworks to animate on the feature Monster House. I also spent time with a handful of independent productions and Blur. Even at a young age, I had major issues with the system of production in Los Angeles. I worked for three years as a 3D animator in large studios before retreating to the more interesting, but less lucrative independent world.  I funded my animation experimentation by working contracts in the more story focused Previsualization.
