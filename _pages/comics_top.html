I began drawing comics when I was a kid. In 2010, I started to take my ideas and publish them on the internet. For the last decade, I have continued to create
comics as a hobby, with no pressure or outcome. As a result I often talk of family or internal anxieties.
It's my favorite form of self expression. So, while I spend my days stuck in computer graphics, my release is still a pencil on a
sketchbook page. You can see a lot of who I am in these works.
