<br>
I am an animator, educator and computer graphics researcher. For many years, I worked as a contract animator and visualization artist on a [number of high profile projects.](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1100970/) I was also involved in several game and real time start ups. Now, I spend a lot of time thinking about how artists and animators will use automation tools and networked technology. For more information [you can check out my bio and CV.](https://nyeguy.github.io/cv/)
<br>

Feel free to [read some of the posts in my blog.](https://nyeguy.github.io/year-archive/)
Or, if real time animation or game development interests you, [check out some of the classes I teach at SCAD.](https://nyeguy.github.io/teaching/)I also do consulting and research with [Box Rocket Studio.](http://boxrocket.studio)
<br>

You can look at some of my past projects in my portfolio. There's [machine learning stuff,](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/machine-learning-experiments) or [some games I've made.](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/game-development) You can learn about [the movies I worked on.](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/previsualization) Or maybe, check out [some of the comics I've scribbled](https://nyeguy.github.io/comics/) over the years.

I have a wide range of interests about all kinds of stuff. Feel free to say *"hello."*
