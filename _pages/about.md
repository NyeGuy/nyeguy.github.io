<br>
I am an animator, and worked as a contract animator for many years. <br>
Now ... call me crazy, but I'm starting to [think characters will start to animate themselves.](https://nyeguy.github.io/year-archive/drafts/2020-05-02-animation-3)

If you are interested in this line of thinking, [read some of my posts in my blog.](https://nyeguy.github.io/year-archive/)
Or, if real time animation interests you, [check out some of the classes I teach.](https://nyeguy.github.io/teaching/)
<br>
You can look at some of my past projects in my portfolio. There's [machine learning stuff,](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/2020-05-01-machine-learning-experiments) or [some games I've made.](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/2020-05-06-game-development) Or learn about [the movies I worked on](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/2020-05-10-previsualization) Or maybe, check out [some of the comics I've scribbled](https://nyeguy.github.io/teaching/) for fun over the years.
<br>
I have a wide range of interests about all kinds of stuff, so feel free to say 'hello'.
I'm on twitter [@nyewarburton](http://twitter.com/nyewarburton). My DM's are open.

Thanks for coming by!
