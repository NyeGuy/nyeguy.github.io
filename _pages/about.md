I am the Associate Chair of Interactive Design and Game Development at [(SCAD) the Savannah College of Art and Design.](https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/interactive-design-and-game-development) I also consult on real time projects with [Box Rocket Studio.](https://boxrocket.studio)

At SCAD, I research and teach [Animation for Games,](http://blog.scad.edu/nwarburt), a class that allows my continued focus on real time [characters, game mechanics, and AI.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/AnimatingObjects/SkeletalMeshAnimation/StateMachines/Overview/index.html) I work with both game developers and animators to push the immersive quality of the student games. I also teach a variety of classes in Unreal development, art and with [SCAD's innovation program.](https://www.scad.edu/about/scadpro) In addition to teaching, as associate chair, I am responsible for the strategy and development of [SCAD Games Studio,](https://scaditgm.blog/scad-games-studio/) where I facilitate the workflow development and shipping of student games.

Prior to my work at SCAD, my career spanned animated television, national commercials, independent game development, and [30+ feature films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1100970/) including Monster House, Battleship, Avengers, Men in Black III, and Oblivion. Working with startups, I developed projects with Disney Imagineering, Pearson Education, Comedy Central, Sony Television Games, and medical professionals from USC and Cedars-Sinai.

My technical focus is with animation data and real time animation systems. As a journeyman animator and previsualization artist, I work with Autodesk Maya and a variety of motion capture platforms. I primarily develop my real time work in [Epic's Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com), but sometimes also work with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the open source [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). I also experiment with machine learning models where I use a variety of interfaces and code libraries. A selection of some of my works are in my portfolio.

My creative side is improvisational. That is to say, I don't know where I go day to day. I understand that focused discipline destroys the ability to be impulsively creative. [I counter this societal structure by allowing myself to actively draw and write when I can](http://nyetoon), often without defined focus or outcome. These tend to be moments that I am most myself.

As an educator, I strive to bring network technology, open source, and new collaborative strategies to the content I develop. I believe the paradigm for how we learn is changing, and education is not something simply for an elite class of human. In the world of tomorrow, we will all be building [the metaverse together,](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) and it is critical that every human, with resources or not, understand the virtual world and the real time characters that will inhabit it.

If you are an artist or technologist from any discipline, I welcome collaborations and new ideas. If you follow me on twitter, my DM's are always open.
