![Nye Warburton](images\nyetoon_header.png)
I spent a a long time as an animator. Now, call me crazy, but I'm starting to think characters will animate themselves.

If you are interested, [read some of my thoughts in my blog.](https://nyeguy.github.io/year-archive/)
Or, [check out some of the classes I teach.](https://nyeguy.github.io/teaching/)

You can look at some of my past projects in my portfolio. There's machine learning stuff, or some games I've made. Read about [the movies I worked on, etc. Or if you want, check out some of the comics I've scribbled for fun over the years.
<br>
I have a wide range of interests about all kinds of stuff, so feel free to say 'hello'.
I suppose I am on twitter.  I never tweet, I'm one of those "doom scrolling types," but my DM's are always open.
