![Nye Warburton](images\nyetoon_header.png)
I spent a long time drawing, doing computer graphics, and animating content in movies and games. Now, I have this crazy idea I'm chasing. 
I think it might be possible for animated characters to start moving themselves.

If you are interested, read some of my thoughts in my blog. Or, check out some of the teaching I do.

You can look at some of my past projects in my portfolio. There's machine learning stuff, or some games I've made. Read about the movies I worked on, etc. Or if you want, check out some of the comics I've scribbled for fun over the years.

By the way, if you are an artist or technologist from any discipline, I welcome new ideas.
I have a wide range of interests about all kinds of stuff, so just say 'hello'.
I never tweet, I'm just one of those doom scrolling types. But my DM's are open.
