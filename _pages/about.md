<br>
I am an animator. I worked as a contract animator for many years. <br>
Now, my creative focus is spent researching and teaching animation systems for real time development.
<br>

Feel free to [read some of the posts in my blog.](https://nyeguy.github.io/year-archive/)
Or, if real time animation interests you, [check out some of the classes I teach.](https://nyeguy.github.io/teaching/)
<br>

You can look at some of my past projects in my portfolio. There's [machine learning stuff,](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/machine-learning-experiments) or [some games I've made.](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/game-development) You can learn about [the movies I worked on.](https://nyeguy.github.io/portfolio/previsualization) Or maybe, check out [some of the comics I've scribbled](https://nyeguy.github.io/comics/) over the years.
<br>

I have a wide range of interests about all kinds of stuff. Feel free to say *"hello."*
