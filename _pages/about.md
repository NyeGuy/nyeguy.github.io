#Education
I am the Associate Chair of Interactive Design and Game Development at [(SCAD) the Savannah College of Art and Design.](https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/interactive-design-and-game-development) I also consult on animation, game development and real time projects with [Box Rocket Studio.](https://boxrocket.studio)

Prior to my work at SCAD, my career spanned animated television, national commercials, independent game development, and [30+ feature films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1100970/) including Monster House, Battleship, Avengers, Men in Black III, and Oblivion. Working with startups, I developed projects with Disney Imagineering, Pearson Education, Comedy Central, Sony Television Games, and medical professionals from USC and Cedars-Sinai.

# Computer Graphics
My technical focus is with animation data and real time animation systems. As a journeyman animator and previsualization artist, I work with Autodesk Maya and a variety of motion capture platforms. I primarily develop my real time work in [Epic's Unreal Engine](https://unrealengine.com), but sometimes also work with [Unity](https://unity.com/) and the open source [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). I also experiment with machine learning models where I use a variety of interfaces and code libraries. A selection of some of my works are in my portfolio.

# Fun and Family
Despite a track record of movies, heady animation technology, and network research, I still love to draw comics, play with technology, and build games. I also have a wife and two kids, which keeps me very busy, but happy.

# Collaboration is everything
If you are an artist or technologist from any discipline, I welcome (crave) collaborations and new ideas. It's at the intersection of contrasting ideas that real creativity emerges.

If you follow me on twitter, my DM's are always open.
