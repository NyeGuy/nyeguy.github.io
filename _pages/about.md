I'm an animator, which might call to your mind an image of some person who moves characters around a screen for companies. Yes, I did that for a while. But now, I like to think of it more as a "graphics hacker." I smash technology to play with ideas, and those ideas often manifest into characters and experiences. 

I am the Associate Chair of Interactive Design and Game Development at [(SCAD) the Savannah College of Art and Design.](https://www.scad.edu/academics/programs/interactive-design-and-game-development) At SCAD, I research and teach [Animation for Games,](http://blog.scad.edu/nwarburt)a class that focuses on the development of real time [characters, game mechanics, and AI.](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/AnimatingObjects/SkeletalMeshAnimation/StateMachines/Overview/index.html) I also teach a variety of classes in game development and with [SCAD's innovation program.](https://www.scad.edu/about/scadpro) In addition to teaching, as associate chair, I am responsible for the strategy and development of [SCAD Games Studio,](https://scaditgm.blog/scad-games-studio/) where I facilitate the workflow and shipping of student games.

Prior to my work at SCAD, my career spanned animated television, national commercials, independent game development, and [30+ feature films](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1100970/) including Monster House, Battleship, Avengers, Men in Black III, and Oblivion. Working with startups, I developed projects with Disney Imagineering, Pearson Education, Comedy Central, Sony Television Games, and medical professionals from USC and Cedars-Sinai. I currently consult on animation, content strategy, game development and real time projects with [Box Rocket Studio.](https://boxrocket.studio) I also draw comics, play with machine learning, and develop real time/game prototypes.

If you are an artist or technologist from any discipline, I welcome collaborations and new ideas.
I have a wide range of interests that intersect with computer graphics and animation including: AI, Bots, VR, AR, distributed networks, open source, but also
comedy, story, philosophy and human psychology.

[I'm an obsessive twitter scroller despite almost never actually tweeting.](https://twitter.com/nyewarburton) My DM's are always open.
