This is an core curriculum course on the structure of game engines and blueprinting for the Unreal Engine. It follows a syllabus and structure developed by Aram Cookson.

I used the curriculum and adapted it to define two projects for the students. The first was a first person camera dungeon explorer. The second project was a top down shooter with a playable character.

This is a selection of works from my most recent class' final project:
