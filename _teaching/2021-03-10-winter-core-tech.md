This is a core curriculum course on the structure of game engines and blueprinting for the Unreal Engine. It follows a syllabus and structure developed by [Aram Cookson](https://www.scad.edu/academics/faculty/aram-cookson).

I used the curriculum and adapted it to define two projects for the students. The first was a first person camera dungeon explorer. The second project was a top down shooter with a playable character.

This is a selection of works from my most recent class' final project:

This is work from Adria Graham, Griffin Long, Church Leu and Pierce Rudman.
